					<p>In <em>2018</em> I will be early in my career, post graduation from the <a href="http://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/plandescr.aspx?prg=iftg&pln=it-internt" target="_new" id="externalLink">Web Programming Concentration</a> at Nova Scotia Community College's Institute of Technology campus in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Upon graduation I will gain employment directly related to web and mobile application development in Halifax. My employment situation will challenge me everyday, while fostering my growth as a young, confident professional. I will work closely within a small team, dealing with the latest industry languages and standards as we produce a exciting, unique and sound products.<br /><br /> 
					
					I will also have made significant progress on my <em>"personal project"</em> (done as a side web project) that will enhance my online presence and boost my portfolio accolades. This project will be done on spare time and reflect my skills as I grow in the industry. The ultimate goal for my side project is twofold: 1. Further highlight my capabilities and reflect my creative, hard working and passionate characteristics, and 2. generate widely accepted appreciation and valued recognition through generated traffic and/or income generated.

					<h5 id="10">- 10 YEAR PLAN -</h5>
					
					<p>In <em>2023</em>, ten years after graduation I will be with the same company that hired me as a very young professional. Recently, I was promoted within the company to the position of Team Leader. I am responsible for a small team of web developers and looked upon as a leader in the company. I will have grown into a more confident and talented individual in the technology industry, and someone who pursues education relentlessly. I will use my situation with my current company to continue my growth as a professional and an individual. This will be highlighted by the launch of many successful websites and mobile applications. My success will be due to the attention I place on the company's clients. I will be known in the industry as someone who is a great personality to work with and relied upon to deliver a beautiful, well-functioning product.
					<br /><br /> 
					In the decade since graduation from the NSCC I will have added to my portfolio tremendously. Throughout the years my skills and knowledge will have grown exponentially, and this growth would be reflected by the success of my "personal project." This project is now generating passive income and experiences significant new traffic monthly. This "personal project" will be built in such a way that it is a vehicle for an independent business that will require my full attention in the very near future. I plan on working for myself as an entrepreneur, on this product, within the new 10-15 years. </p>

					<p>In <em>2033</em>, two decades have past since my graduation from NSCC. I continue to enjoy my career as a web and mobile application specialist. I am a well respected professional within the industry and the company I began my career with. I am looked at as a creative, innovative, knowledgeable and reliable individual who can produce clean, attractive, responsive and functional products that reflect the client's wishes. I have climbed the ranks within the company that hired me after graduation. I am now head of the web and mobile department as I oversee a variety of projects from the early stages to its completion. The majority of the products that are produced by this company are a direct result of my leadership and decisions. I am responsible for a large team of professionals who rely on my for direction, answers and support as we work together to deliver current and trend-setting products.<br /><br />
					
					Twenty years have passed since the beginning stages of my "personal project" were put into place. It has become a passionate hobby of mine that I have groomed as a product that I will pursue full time. As an integral part of my life, my "personal project" will be constant motivation to produce an outstanding project that bears my name and is a symbol of industry progression. </p>
